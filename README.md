Mycroft skill that allows a user to connect to their own CalDAV Server and retrieve their events from a particular date and read them out back to the user, as well as allowing them to create their own events using Mycroft and save them into the server.

## About
Skill allows the user to connect to their CalDAV Server using their credentials and using their default calendar. It allows a user to search for a particular date (Tomorrow, next monday, etc) and will retrieve the events on that particular date if it finds any before reading them out to the user.

Also allows users to create an event on that date by asking users for the summary, the date and the time of the event and saves it to the calendar after it has been confirmed. 

## Examples
* ### Searching
* "Do i have anything on {date}"
* "Is there anything in my schedule {date}"
* "What's on my agenda for {date}"
* "Do i have any events for {date}"
* ### Creating
* "Create an Event in my calendar"
* "Add an Event in my calendar"
